# split.count
An R function to handle a column of a Data-frame or Matrix. 
It splits them by how we want and then counts different objects in the column.
The function has two parameters : 
x = Column of a Data-frame or Matrix. 
y = The object through which we want to split each row of the column.  

split.count( x , y )

# It counts how many each of the instances are present in all the rows of the column.
## I have made this function during my data-cleaning process of my college project.
